# object-segmentation/object-detection

To run either of the jupyter notebook on local machine the [installation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) instructions need to be followed.

The [Object detection in Images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tULD2dXLhrC3UNs3ZAX181y6Y4MRCMnu?usp=sharing) and [Image Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a3epWOWZwW7xf_u7hGfjekuiE2O4Cztq?usp=sharing) can be run on google colab fromt the following links
The [object detection on live video](https://github.com/datasciencemachine/object-detection-instance-segmentation/blob/trials/object_detection/Object-detection%20in%20live%20video.ipynb) file can only be run on local machine as google colab cannot read from webcam.

## ISSUES:
In case of [Object-detection in live video](https://github.com/datasciencemachine/object-detection-instance-segmentation/blob/trials/object_detection/Object-detection%20in%20live%20video.ipynb) doesn't work try changing the value in cap.Capture() inside the bracket

## NOTE:
The github notebooks and the google colab files are different, for local machines always download github notebooks
